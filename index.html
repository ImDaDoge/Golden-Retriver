<h2>Personality</h2>
<p> The Golden Retriever is well tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden Retrievers are playful but gentle towards children. 
<br>
They tend to get along well with other pets and strangers.
These dogs are eager to please, which may explain why they respond so 
<br>well to obedience training and are popular service dogs.
They also like to work, whether it is hunting birds or bringing guardian slippers.
<br>
Golden Retrievers are usually not skinners, they lack the instinct of a guard, so don't expect them to be good watchdogs. However, some 
<br>
golden retrievers will notify you when a stranger approaches.
